              We started the day with a walk along the beach. The waves were too strong to swim, but it was peaceful and the soft white sand was so clean.

              The downtown was small yet charming. There were a lot of restaurants and shops. We stopped by a local honey shop, and Ice bought a mead flight made with local honey. Very high alcohol content lol.

              Lots of kites and music. We have never seen such scene outside of asia. I believed we saw blue angels zooming over us multiple times throughout the day.

              We were on the way to the National Naval Aviation Museum, but decided to stop by the lighthouse first. The view from the top was amazing, but the walk up and down was tough. I ended up with trembling hand due to gripping the railing too hard. The drive was quite long from the hotel, but we enjoyed our views for the day.

              Departure day ! We met up with ate Belle and kuya Raymond on their way to Destin before heading out to the airport. We had already went here the night before ,and thought that they would enjoy the seafood and experience. We had a great time, and it was hands down one of the best get-together.
